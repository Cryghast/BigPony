# BigPony
Big Pony is a companion mod for MineLittlePony (though is not required). It allows you to customize the way you appear in the world, including model scaling and camera position. It is the spiritual successor to [FillyCam](https://github.com//MineLittlePony/FillyCam) by Hepolite.

In order to communicate your settings to other players, [PlayerSync](https://github.com/killjoy1221/PlayerSync) is required to be installed on both the client and server. If you don't wish to see others scaling, you do not need to install this.

## Installation
LiteLoader is required. After installing that, move the downloaded .litemod file into `.minecraft/mods`. PlayerSync goes into the same folder.
